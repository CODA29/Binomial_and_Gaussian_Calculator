# Binomial_and_Gaussian_Calculator
This function calculates the mean, standard deviation, and plot a histogram and/or bar-chart of a Binomial and Gaussian distributions.

This package has been published on pypi.org 
If you wish to install the package in your local environment, use this command:
				- pip install bino-dag-prob

To use the Binomial and Gaussian functions in your project, use this command:

				- from bino_dag_prob import Binomial
				- from bino_dag_prob import Gaussian

A usecase scenario of these functions would be:

				Binomial(x,y)
				Gaussian(x,y)
		
In each case the functions would return the mean and standard deviation of the corresponding distribution.
